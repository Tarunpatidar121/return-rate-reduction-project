 "E-commerce Return Rate Reduction Analysis3"
##Objective

The goal of this project is to identify the key factors influencing product returns and analyze how return rates vary across:

Product categories

Geographic regions

Marketing channels

Additionally, the project aims to predict the probability of a product being returned and visualize insights through an interactive Power BI dashboard.

* Tools and Technologies

Python â†’ Data cleaning, preprocessing, and machine learning (Logistic Regression)

SQL â†’ Data extraction, transformation, and aggregation

Power BI â†’ Interactive dashboard and visualizations

*Project Workflow
1. Data Preparation

Import and inspect raw e-commerce order and return datasets

Handle missing values, outliers, and duplicates

Standardize categorical variables and format date fields

2. SQL Analysis

Join order and return tables

Calculate return percentage per category, supplier, and region

Create summary tables for Power BI visualization

3. Python Modeling

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Use Logistic Regression to predict the probability of product returns

Generate a return risk score for each product

Export final dataset (CSV) containing product details and risk scores

4. Power BI Dashboard

Import processed data and create visuals for:

Return Rate by Category

Return Rate by Region

Marketing Channel Analysis

Supplier-wise Return Comparison

Return Risk Score Visualization

Add drill-through filters for product, region, and supplier analysis

ðŸ“Š Deliverables

âœ… Interactive Power BI Dashboard with drill-through filters
âœ… Python Codebase for data processing and prediction
âœ… SQL Queries for data aggregation and transformation
âœ… CSV File of high-risk products with predicted return probabilities


* Setup Instructions

Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Ecommerce-Return-Rate-Analysis.git
cd Ecommerce-Return-Rate-Analysis


Install Dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt


Run Notebooks

Open Jupyter Notebook or VS Code

Execute scripts inside the notebooks/ folder

Open Power BI Dashboard

Load the return_dashboard.pbix file

Connect it to the processed_data.csv for dynamic updates

* Insights Example

Electronics and fashion categories show higher return rates.

Returns are more frequent in regions with longer delivery times.

Products promoted via social media ads tend to have higher return probabilities.

 *Future Improvements

Integrate real-time order data via APIs

Experiment with Random Forest or XGBoost for better prediction accuracy

Deploy dashboard via Power BI Service for team access
